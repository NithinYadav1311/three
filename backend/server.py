---

## ⚠️ STEP 0 — JOB DESCRIPTION VALIDATION (Run this BEFORE anything else)

Before scoring, validate the JD for completeness. Check how many of these are present:

- [ ] At least 3 specific required skills or technologies
- [ ] At least 1 clearly defined role responsibility
- [ ] At least 1 experience requirement (years of experience or seniority level)
- [ ] A clear role title or domain

### If 0 or 1 are present → STOP. Do not score. Return this exactly:
"⚠️ Invalid or Empty Job Description: The provided JD does not contain enough 
information to perform a meaningful ATS analysis. A score cannot be generated 
without at least a defined role, required skills, and responsibilities. 
Please provide a complete job description."

### If exactly 2 are present → Proceed with a Thin JD Warning:
"⚠️ Thin JD Warning: This JD is underdefined. Scoring has low confidence and 
should be treated as approximate only."
- In this case: penalize both Keyword Match and Skills Alignment heavily since 
  there is nothing concrete to match against.
- The score for ANY resume against a thin JD must naturally land between 30–50.
- A resume cannot score above 40 against a vague or near-empty JD. Hard limit.

### If 3 or 4 are present → Proceed with full scoring below.

## JOB DESCRIPTION

Description: {job_data['description']}
Requirements: {job_data.get('requirements', 'Not specified')}

## RESUME

{resume_text}

---

## STEP 1 — RESUME vs JD DIFFERENTIAL ANALYSIS

Before assigning dimension scores, perform this comparison:

1. Extract ALL must-have requirements from the JD (skills, tools, years, responsibilities).
2. Extract ALL nice-to-have requirements from the JD.
3. For EACH requirement, locate the exact evidence in the resume that satisfies it.
4. Tag each requirement as one of:
   - ✅ FULLY MET — demonstrated in context (project, work experience, or certification)
   - ⚠️ PARTIALLY MET — mentioned but not demonstrated anywhere = 50% credit only
   - ❌ MISSING — not found anywhere in the resume

This mapping drives every dimension score. Do not score dimensions without completing 
this step. This is what ensures two different resumes get two different scores against 
the same JD, and the same resume gets different scores against different JDs.

---

## STEP 2 — SCORING DIMENSIONS

### 1. Skills Alignment (Weight: 25%)
- Separate JD skills into Must-Have vs Nice-to-Have.
- Must-Have skills carry 2x the weight of Nice-to-Have skills.
- A skill demonstrated in projects or work experience = full credit.
- A skill only listed in a skills section with no supporting context = 50% credit only.
- A must-have skill completely missing = 0 credit and triggers the 74-point hard cap.
- Do not assume skill competence. Evidence or nothing.

### 2. Experience Relevance (Weight: 20%)
- Compare years of experience required vs what the candidate has (total + domain-specific).
- Evaluate role title similarity: same title, adjacent, or unrelated.
- Measure responsibility overlap: what % of JD responsibilities appear in work history.
- Check seniority alignment — junior resume for a senior role = significant penalty.
- Recency matters: relevant experience from 5+ years ago carries less weight than recent.

### 3. Keyword Match (Weight: 20%)
- Extract all hard keywords from the JD: tools, technologies, frameworks, methodologies, 
  domain-specific terms.
- Check each keyword: does it appear verbatim or as a clear synonym in the resume?
- Placement quality matters: appearing in job title or experience > skills list > projects.
- Keywords listed without any surrounding context = penalized.
- Score = (keywords matched in context / total required keywords) × 100, 
  adjusted for placement quality.

### 4. Project Relevance (Weight: 20%)
- Evaluate projects for domain relevance, tech stack match, scale, and complexity.
- A project matching BOTH the JD domain AND the required tech stack = high value.
- Quantified outcomes (metrics, scale, performance improvements) = bonus.
- Generic tutorial projects, clones, or unrelated work = penalized.
- Production-scale, open-source, or deployed/published work = bonus.
- No projects listed when the JD expects hands-on work = significant penalty.

### 5. Certifications & Education (Weight: 15%)
- Check if the degree field and level match what the JD expects.
- Certifications explicitly or implicitly required by the JD carry strong weight 
  (e.g., AWS for cloud, PMP for project management, CPA for finance).
- Multiple relevant and recent certifications (within 3 years) = bonus.
- If JD has no strict education requirement, shift weight entirely toward certifications.
- Outdated or irrelevant certifications = no credit. Do not pad the score with these.

---

## STEP 3 — SCORING RULES

### Hard Caps (Non-negotiable):
- Any resume scored against an empty or vague JD → cannot exceed 40.
- Any resume missing even one Must-Have JD requirement → cannot exceed 74, 
  regardless of how strong the rest of the resume is.
- A skill listed without supporting evidence anywhere → 50% credit only, always.

### Anti-Sandbagging Rules — Score must reflect evidence, not caution:
- If ALL must-have skills are demonstrated with evidence → Skills dimension must score 85+.
- If all required keywords appear in context, not just listed → Keyword score must be 85+.
- If projects directly match the JD domain and tech stack → Project score must be 80+.
- A resume meeting all must-haves + most nice-to-haves + relevant projects + relevant 
  certifications → Overall score MUST be 85–95. Refusing to go above 75 here is a 
  scoring error.
- Never apply a hidden penalty for "seems too good." Score what the evidence shows.

### Anti-Inflation Rules — Do not give what wasn't earned:
- Do not award points for potential, effort, or how the resume reads.
- Do not generalize or assume competence from vague statements.
- Do not give a mid-range score just because you're uncertain — low confidence 
  should lower the score, not normalize it.

### Calibration Reference:
| Score   | Meaning                                                              |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 90–100  | Near-perfect fit. Almost every requirement met with clear evidence.  |
| 80–89   | Strong fit. All must-haves met, minor gaps in nice-to-haves only.   |
| 70–79   | Good fit. 1–2 must-haves are weak or missing.                       |
| 50–69   | Moderate fit. Multiple gaps across dimensions.                       |
| 30–49   | Weak fit. Significant misalignment in core areas.                   |
| Below 30| Poor fit. Resume and JD are largely misaligned.                     |

---

## RULE 1 — WORD COUNT

Every email you generate MUST be between 300 and 350 words.
This includes the body only — subject line and sign-off are not counted.

---

## RULE 2 — MISSING FIELDS

If any detail (date, time, location, meeting link, HR name, or job role) 
is missing or not provided:
- Do NOT leave a blank or placeholder like [DATE] or [MEETING LINK].
- Instead, naturally replace it with: "we will inform you shortly" or 
  "details will be shared with you soon."
- The email must always read as complete and professional — never expose 
  missing fields to the candidate.

---

## RULE 3 — STAGE-SPECIFIC LOGIC

### 🔵 Screening
- Inform the candidate their application is under review.
- Let them know they've entered the screening stage.
- Tone should be welcoming and encouraging.

### 🟡 Shortlisted
- Congratulate the candidate on being shortlisted.
- Express genuine excitement about their profile.
- Tone should be warm and positive.

### 🟢 Interview
- Inform the candidate they've been selected for an interview.
- If date/time/location provided → include clearly.
- If missing → replace with "we will inform you shortly."
- Include preparation tips if tone is Friendly or Casual.

### 🟠 Offer
- Congratulate the candidate warmly on receiving an offer.
- Keep the tone celebratory but professional.
- Do not mention specific salary or compensation details.

### 🔴 Rejection
- Be empathetic, respectful, and kind.
- Thank the candidate sincerely for their time and effort.
- Encourage them to apply for future opportunities.
- Never be blunt or cold. Always soften the message.

---

## RULE 4 — TONE BEHAVIOR

### Professional
- Formal language, structured sentences.
- Salutation: "Dear [Name],"
- Closing: "Best regards,"

### Friendly
- Warm, conversational, enthusiastic.
- Salutation: "Hi [Name],"
- Closing: "Warm regards,"

### Urgent
- Direct, concise, action-oriented.
- Salutation: "Dear [Name],"
- Closing: "Regards,"

### Casual
- Relaxed and human. Light language.
- Salutation: "Hey [Name],"
- Closing: "Cheers,"
