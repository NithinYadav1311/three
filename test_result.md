# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      🔥 URGENT FIX APPLIED - Groq Library Compatibility Issue:
      
      ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
      - User reported: ResizeObserver errors, "failed to load" on every page, job creation failing, screening failing
      - Investigation revealed: Groq library v0.11.0 has incompatibility with httpx proxies
      - Error: "TypeError: Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'"
      - This prevented backend from starting, causing ALL API calls to fail
      
      FIXES APPLIED:
      1. ✅ Upgraded groq library from 0.11.0 to 1.0.0
      2. ✅ Updated requirements.txt with new version
      3. ✅ Backend successfully imports and runs
      4. ✅ Suppressed benign ResizeObserver loop errors in frontend (harmless React warnings)
      5. ✅ Both backend and frontend services running successfully
      
      VERIFICATION:
      - Backend: RUNNING (pid 1033)
      - Frontend: RUNNING (pid 1092)
      - MongoDB: RUNNING
      - Backend API responding correctly (tested /api/jobs endpoint)
      - All Groq AI features should now work: resume parsing, ATS screening, email generation

      ✅ NEW SESSION - Dialog Popup Movement Issues FIXED:
      
      USER REPORTED ISSUES:
      1. Calendar "Add Event" popup - moving on hover, difficult to fill form
      2. Dashboard candidate details popup (eye button) - same movement issue
      
      ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
      - Both dialogs use .glass-card CSS class which has hover effect
      - .glass-card:hover applies transform: translateY(-2px) scale(1.01)
      - This caused popups to shift position while user hovers/interacts with form fields
      - DialogContent also had excessive slide/zoom animations from Radix UI
      
      FIXES APPLIED:
      1. ✅ Created new CSS class .glass-card-dialog (index.css line 189-193)
         - Same glassmorphism styling as .glass-card
         - NO hover transform effects
         - Prevents popup movement while filling forms
      
      2. ✅ Simplified Dialog animations (dialog.jsx)
         - Removed: zoom-out-95, zoom-in-95, slide-out, slide-in animations
         - Kept: Only fade-in/fade-out for smooth open/close
         - Result: Dialog stays perfectly centered and stable
      
      3. ✅ Updated Calendar.js (line 433)
         - Changed: glass-card → glass-card-dialog
         - Removed: animate-modal-slide-up class
         - Add Event popup now stays fixed while user fills form
      
      4. ✅ Updated Dashboard.js (line 1171)
         - Changed: glass-card → glass-card-dialog
         - Candidate details popup (eye button) now stays fixed

      3. ✅ CALENDAR ADD EVENT POPUP - Layout Fixes (Calendar.js lines 428-612):
         
         Root Cause: Fixed width (600px) and tight grid columns causing field cutting
         
         Fixes Applied:
         - Dialog width: max-w-2xl w-[600px] → max-w-3xl w-full mx-4 sm:w-[700px]
         - Content area: max-h-[60vh] → max-h-[70vh] with px-1 padding
         - Spacing: space-y-3 → space-y-4 (better breathing room)
         - Grid responsiveness:
           * Type/Status/Color: grid-cols-3 → grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-3
           * Date/Time: grid-cols-2 → grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2
           * Candidate fields: grid-cols-2 → grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2
         - All inputs: Added w-full to ensure full width within containers
         - Input heights: h-9 → h-10 (better touch targets)
         - Color buttons: w-7 → w-8 with ring-2 on selection
         - Action buttons: Responsive flex-col sm:flex-row, w-full sm:w-auto
         - Labels: space-y-1 → space-y-1.5
